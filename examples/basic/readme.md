# Basic Example

A basic example of a TypeScript library that is compiled by Package Bundler. Clone this repository, cd to this folder, run npm install and then npm run build. The built contents should end up in ./dist by default.

## Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm pack`
4. Observe context of the resulting `tarball` to verify built package contents
